## Glider

Glider is a GPS-Odometry-INS system, it is designed to fuse GPS and IMU (a GINS system) with any odometry you provide. This can also be run as a standard GINS system by setting `use_odom:=false`. We can also take in unscaled odometry and scale it, just set `scale_odom` parameter to `true` if you want your odmetry scaled. Finally, noise parameters can be configured in `config/graph_params.yaml`.

You can build this as a ros2 package with colcon: `colcon build --packages-select glider`.

### Running
Glider can be built as a ros packages in your ros workspace with `catkin build`.
Run glider with:
```
ros2 launch glider glider-node.launch.py
```

Everything will be rotated into the ENU frame, includeing the IMU orientation and the Odometry pose. Since GPS is the main prior, we publish state estimates in the ENU frame with UTM coordinates as an `Odometry` ros message or a `NavSatFix` message. This can be configured in `config/ros_params.yaml` with the `publish_nav_sat_fix` parameter.

### Building and Running Unit Tests
We use GTest to run unit tests. You can build the tests with 
``` 
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```
and run with:
```
cd build 
ctest
```
